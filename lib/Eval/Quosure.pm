=method expr

Get the expression stored in the object.

=method captures

Get the captured variables stored in the object. Returns a hashref with
keys being variables names including sigil and values being references
to the variables.

=method caller

Get the caller info stored in the object.
Returns an arrayref of same structure as what the C<caller()> returns.

=method eval

    eval(HashRef $additional_captures={})

Evaluate the quosure's expression in its own environment, with captured
variables from what's obtained when the quosure's created plus specified
by C<$additional_captures>, which is a hashref with keys be the full name
of the variable including sigil.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Eval::Quosure;

    sub foo {
        my $a = 2;
        my $b = 3;
        return Eval::Quosure->new('bar($a, $b, $c)');
    }

    sub bar {
        my ($a, $b, $c) = @_;
        return $a * $b * $c;
    }

    my $q = foo();

    my $a = 0;  # This is not used when evaluating the quosure.
    print $q->eval( { '$c' => 7 } ), "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class acts similar to R's "quosure". A "quosure" is an object
that combines an expression and an environment in which the expression
can be evaluated. 

Note that as this is string eval so is not secure. USE IT WITH CAUTION!

=head1 CONSTRUCTION

    new(Str $expr, $level=0)

C<$expr> is a string. C<$level> is used like the argument of C<caller> and
PadWalker's C<peek_my>, C<0> is for the scope that creates the quosure
object, C<1> is for the upper scope of the scope that creates the quosure,
and so on. 

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<R's "rlang" package|https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rlang> which
provides quosure.
